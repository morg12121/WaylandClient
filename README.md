# WaylandClient
Tries to open a simple window using the Wayland protocol (sway).

# Important
The code relies on "xdg-shell-protocol.c" and "xdg-shell-cleint-protocol.h", both of which are created on compile (look at the makefile for further information).

# Features
Currently it only sets up a very basic window (with some bugs as goodies). It shows rudimentary changing image for demonstration purposes.
I may or may not add more features to this code for educational purposes.
